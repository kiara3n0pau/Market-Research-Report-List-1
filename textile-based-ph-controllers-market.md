<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Textile Based pH Controllers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Acid Donor</li><li>Alkali Donor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Textile-based pH controllers are innovative materials that manage the acidity or alkalinity of textiles. The market is divided into two main types: acid donors and alkali donors. Acid donor textiles release acidic substances to lower pH levels, enhancing properties like antimicrobial effects and colorfastness. Conversely, alkali donor textiles release alkaline substances to elevate pH, which can improve comfort and moisture management. These applications are crucial in producing functional textiles for various industries, including apparel, healthcare, and home textiles.</p></p>
