<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Space Heating Boilers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-condensing Boilers</li><li>Condensing Boilers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The space heating boilers market consists of two primary types: non-condensing boilers and condensing boilers. Non-condensing boilers operate at lower efficiency, releasing excess heat through flue gases, making them less environmentally friendly. In contrast, condensing boilers are designed to capture and reuse this heat, achieving higher efficiency and reducing emissions. As energy conservation becomes more critical, the demand for condensing boilers is rising, while non-condensing boilers remain popular in specific applications due to their lower initial costs.</p></p>
